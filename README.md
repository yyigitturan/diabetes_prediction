# Diabetes Prediction Project


## About

The Diabetes Prediction Project utilizes the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is diabetic or not, focusing specifically on females. This dataset contains medical and demographic information, allowing us to explore the relationships between various factors and diabetes risk.

## Dataset

The Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset includes features such as age, glucose levels, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin levels, BMI, and more. This dataset is used to train and evaluate our predictive model.

## Project Overview

The project follows these main steps:

1. Data Collection and Analysis
2. Data Preprocessing and Visualization
3. Feature Standardization
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Selection and Training
6. Model Evaluation and Accuracy
7. Making Predictions

## Running the Code

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install required libraries:

3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:


## Outcome

The trained model's accuracy is approximately 77.27% on the test dataset. You can also use the model to predict whether a female individual is likely to have diabetes or not based on her medical attributes.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook for detailed code explanations and insights.
